This is a console version of a BlackJack game written in JavaScript. 

This is a basic verison on BlackJack, where one player will play against the dealer in the console of a browser.

The player will start with a balance of $100, and can bet any amount they wish, with a minimum bet of $10.

The player will play first, and select hit or stay based on thier choice and cards. Then dealer will then play, the dealers logic is similar to a casino where they will hit if under 17, and stay if at 17 or above. The winner will then be decided. The the bets will be payed out. 

The player after the hand is done, will either select to stop playing of continue. The purpose this game is to create the game engine for BlackJack, which then a GUI verison can be built on.
